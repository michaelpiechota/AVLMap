This is a Java class called "AVLMap<K,V>" that has an API implementation exactly like that of java.util.TreeMap which is implententd as a Red-Black Tree. (Java SE8) 

API:
Constructor: AVLMap<K,V>()
clear()
containsKey(Object key)
containsValue(Object value)
get(Object key)
put(K key, V value)
remove(Object key)
size()
This class acts exactly like java.util.TreeMap in all respects for these methods, but uses an AVL Map.
