Create a java class called "AVLMap<K,V>" that adheres to the following:

Two source files named EXACTLY "AVLMap.java" and "AVLNode.java"
Your authorship information should be in a comment that appears on the first page when printed.
You must implement the following API EXACTLY the same as it is for java.util.TreeMap in Java SE 8.
 Constructor: AVLMap<K,V>()
clear()
containsKey(Object key)
containsValue(Object value)
get(Object key)
put(K key, V value)
remove(Object key)
size()
You must throw, return and accept everything that Java SE specifies for java.util.TreeMap.

You must act EXACTLY like java.util.TreeMap in all respects for these methods.
